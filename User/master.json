Some specific questions will ask about your religion and drinking behaviour in response to the pandemic. The experiment should take no longer than 2 hours in total.

Some specific questions will ask about your religion and drinking behaviour in response to the pandemic. The experiment should take no longer than 2 hours in total. You may not wish to participate in this study if answering questions relating to the topics in the title could cause you distress. <span style='color:#f70202'><b><u>Please note that these questionnaires are not being used for diagnosis.

Thus, the study may include a risk of anxiety, sadness or other emotional reactions. If you are concerned about these topics then you may discontinue your participation at any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking part in this study is completely voluntary; you may withdraw at any time without having to give any reason. Please feel free to ask any questions that you may have about this study at any point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you are a Psychology student then you will receive 2 credits through SONA. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis application has been reviewed by the University Research Ethics Committee and has been given a favourable ethical opinion for conduct ([SREC OR UREC NUMBER]).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns about the research, please feel free to contact Anthony Haffey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmail: a.haffey@reading.ac.uk<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you for your help.",

Some specific questions will ask about your religion and drinking behaviour in response to the pandemic. The experiment should take no longer than 2 hours in total.

The experiment should take no longer than [MAXIMUM TIME EXPECTED]. [DESCRIPTION OF ELIGIBILITY AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA].<br>\n<br>\nYour data will be kept confidential and securely stored, with only an anonymous number identifying it. Data collected from this study will be preserved and made available in anonymised form, so that data can be re-used by others.<br>\n<br>\n[DESCRIPTION OF RISKS e.g. We foresee few risks during the experiment, but you will be presented with some negative images, which may evoke an emotional response. Thus, the study may include a mild risk of anxiety, sadness or other emotional reactions. However, those stimuli are widely observed in our daily life. If you are concerned about the images in the study then you may discontinue your participation at any time.]<br>\n<br>\nTaking part in this study is completely voluntary; you may withdraw at any time without having to give any reason. Please feel free to ask any questions that you may have about this study at any point.<br>\n<br>\n[INFORMATION ABOUT COMPENSATION - HOW MUCH AND HOW IT WILL BE DELIVERED e.g. You will receive 0.5 credits through SONA. You will receive a £5 Amazon voucher by email. You will receive £2.50 through Prolific.]<br>\n<br>\nThis application has been reviewed by the University Research Ethics Committee and has been given a favourable ethical opinion for conduct ([SREC OR UREC NUMBER]).<br>\n<br>\nIf you have any questions or concerns about the research, please feel free to contact Investigator1.<br>\n<br>\nEmail: Investigator1, Tel: +44-(0)118-378-XXXX.<br>\n<br>\nThank you for your help.",
