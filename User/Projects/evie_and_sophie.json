Some specific questions will ask about your religion and drinking behaviour in response to the pandemic. The experiment should take no longer than 2 hours in total. You may not wish to participate in this study if answering questions relating to the topics in the title could cause you distress. <span style='color:#f70202'><b><u>Please note that these questionnaires are not being used for diagnosis.

Thus, the study may include a risk of anxiety, sadness or other emotional reactions. If you are concerned about these topics then you may discontinue your participation at any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking part in this study is completely voluntary; you may withdraw at any time without having to give any reason. Please feel free to ask any questions that you may have about this study at any point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you are a Psychology student then you will receive 2 credits through SONA. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis application has been reviewed by the University Research Ethics Committee and has been given a favourable ethical opinion for conduct ([SREC OR UREC NUMBER]).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns about the research, please feel free to contact Anthony Haffey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmail: a.haffey@reading.ac.uk<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you for your help.",
