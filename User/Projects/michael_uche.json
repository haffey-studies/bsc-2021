Some specific questions will ask about your religion and drinking behaviour in response to the pandemic. The experiment should take no longer than 2 hours in total. You may not wish to participate in this study if answering questions relating to the topics in the title could cause you distress. <span style='color:#f70202'><b><u>Please note that these questionnaires are not being used for diagnosis. If you want to check if you have problems with any of the above issues you may want to check in with a health professional.</u></b></span> We would like to highlight some sources of support that relate to the above topics that you can check in with:<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<style>\r\n#contact_table td{\r\n  border: 1px solid black;\r\n}\r\n</style>\r\n<table id=\"contact_table\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Organisation</td>\r\n    <td>What they offer</td>\r\n    <td>Contact Details</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Mind</td>\r\n    <td>Promotes the views and needs of people with mental health difficulties</td>\r\n    <td>Ph: 0300 123 3393 <br>\r\n(Monday-Friday, 9am to 6pm) <br>\r\nWeb: www.mind.org.uk</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Samaritans </td>\r\n    <td>Confidential support for people experiencing feelings of distress or despair</td>\r\n    <td>Ph: 116 123 <br>\r\n(Free 24-hour helpline) <br>\r\nWeb: www.samaritans.org.uk</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>SANE</td>\r\n    <td>Emotional support, information and guidance for people affected by mental illness, their families and carers</td>\r\n    <td>Ph: 0300 304 7000 <br>\r\n(Daily, 4.30pm to 10.30pm)<br>\r\nTextcare: comfort and care via text message, sent when the person needs it most: www.sane.org.uk/textcare <br>\r\nPeer support forum: <br>\r\nwww.sane.org.uk/supportforum; <br>\r\nWeb: www.sane.org.uk/support</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>National Autistic Society</td>\r\n    <td>Provides advice, guidance, help and support on the challenges autistic people and their families face.</td>\r\n    <td>Web: www.autism.org.uk</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nYour data will be kept confidential and securely stored, with only an anonymous number identifying it. Data collected from this study will be preserved and made available in <b>anonymised</b> form, so that data can be re-used by others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe foresee few risks during the experiment, but the questionnaires will reflect on topics in the title, politics, religion and alcohol which may evoke an emotional response. Thus, the study may include a risk of anxiety, sadness or other emotional reactions. If you are concerned about these topics then you may discontinue your participation at any time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking part in this study is completely voluntary; you may withdraw at any time without having to give any reason. Please feel free to ask any questions that you may have about this study at any point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you are a Psychology student then you will receive 2 credits through SONA. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis application has been reviewed by the University Research Ethics Committee and has been given a favourable ethical opinion for conduct ([SREC OR UREC NUMBER]).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns about the research, please feel free to contact Anthony Haffey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmail: a.haffey@reading.ac.uk<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you for your help.",
