<h2>Title of Study: Investigating autistic traits, experience of the pandemic, digital behaviour, anxiety and depression</h2>
<h1>PARTICIPANT INFORMATION SHEET </h1>

We would be grateful if you could assist us by participating in our online study investigating autism, your experience of the pandemic, how much you engage with different types of screen time, and how much you experience anxiety or depressive symptoms. <br>
<br>
In the experiment you will be presented with a series of questionnaires and a task that requires you identify emotions. Some specific questions will ask about your religion and drinking behaviour in response to the pandemic. The experiment should take no longer than 2 hours in total. You may not wish to participate in this study if answering questions relating to the topics in the title could cause you distress. <span style='color:#f70202'><b><u>Please note that these questionnaires are not being used for diagnosis.</u></b></span> We would like to highlight some sources of support that relate to the above topics that you can check in with:<br>
